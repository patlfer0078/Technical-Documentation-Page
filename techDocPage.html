          <p>The Texas A&M-Chevron Engineering Academy at Texas Southmost College is an innovative co-enrollment program that provides a pathway to students interested in pursuing an engineering degree at Texas A&M University. Students admitted to the Engineering Academy at Texas Southmost College are Texas A&M engineering students co-enrolled at Texas A&M University in the College of Engineering and at Texas Southmost College.</p>

          <p>Benefits of the Texas A&M Engineering Academy at Texas Southmost College include:</p

          <ul>
            <li>Being co-enrolled at Texas A&M University and Texas Southmost College. Engineering students in the Engineering Academy program enroll in one engineering course through Texas A&M each semester. These courses are taught by Texas A&M faculty on the Texas Southmost College campus. All math, science and other core curriculum courses are taken through Texas Southmost College;</li>
            <li>Smaller student-faculty ratios in math and science courses, which build the foundation in engineering;</li>
            <li>Automatic admission to the first choice engineering major at the end of the second semester for engineering students who earn a minimum 3.5 cumulative grade point average (CGPA) at both Texas Southmost College and Texas A&M and who complete the required coursework</li>
          </ul>
